### Description

This basic web infrastructure operates a website accessible at www.foobar.com, lacking crucial security elements like firewalls and SSL certificates for network protection. Within this setup, each component, such as the database and application server, must share the server's limited resources, including CPU, RAM, and SSD.

### Infrastructure Specifics

- **Nature of a Server**: A server, either as hardware or software, is dedicated to providing services to other computers, often referred to as clients.
- **Domain Name Role**: A domain name acts as a user-friendly stand-in for an IP address. For instance, www.facebook.org is more recognizable and memorable than its numeric equivalent, 69.63.176.13. This aliasing is coordinated within the Domain Name System (DNS).
- **DNS Record of www.foobar.com**: The site uses an A record for DNS, ascertainable via a 'dig www.foobar.com' command. In this particular setup, an A record links a hostname to its IPv4 address.
- **Function of the Web Server**: The web server, in its hardware or software form, processes requests through HTTP or HTTPS and delivers either the requested resource or an error message.
- **Application Server's Role**: The application server is responsible for installing, operating, and hosting applications and services for end-users, IT services, and organizations, playing a vital role in the deployment and delivery of complex applications.
- **Database Functionality**: The database holds an organized collection of data, ensuring easy access, management, and updates.
- **Server-Client Communication**: Interaction between the client (user's computer requesting the website) and the server happens over the internet, using the TCP/IP protocol suite.

### Infrastructure Challenges

- **Single Points of Failure (SPOF)**: The infrastructure has several SPOFs. For instance, if the MySQL database server fails, the entire site becomes inoperative.
- **Maintenance-Induced Downtime**: Performing maintenance requires shutting down components or the entire server. With only one server, such downtime impacts the website's availability.
- **Scaling Limitations**: Scaling the infrastructure is challenging since a single server holds all essential components. High traffic volumes can quickly deplete resources or slow down server performance.
