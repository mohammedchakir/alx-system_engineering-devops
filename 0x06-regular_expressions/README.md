#### [8. Textme]()

This exercise was prepared for you by Guillaume Plessis, VP of Infrastructure at TextMe. It is something he uses daily. You can thank Guillaume for his project on Twitter.

For this task, you’ll be taking over Guillaume’s responsibilities: one afternoon, a TextMe VoIP Engineer comes to you and explains she wants to run some statistics on the TextMe app text messages transactions.

Requirements:

- Your script should output: `[SENDER]`,`[RECEIVER]`,`[FLAGS]`
   - The sender phone number or name (including country code if present)
   - The receiver phone number or name (including country code if present)
   - The flags that were used
